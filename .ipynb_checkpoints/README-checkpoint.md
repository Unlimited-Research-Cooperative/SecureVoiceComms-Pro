SecureVoiceComms-Pro

Advanced Encrypted Voice Communication System

About SecureVoiceComms-Pro

SecureVoiceComms-Pro is an encrypted voice communication system designed for secure and reliable voice transmissions. Leveraging modern encryption techniques, it provides a robust solution for confidential and clear audio communication.

üåê Features:

- Robust Encryption: Uses standard cryptographic libraries to secure communications.
- Audio Processing: Digital signal processing for audio capture and playback.
- File-based Transmission Simulation: Simulates transmission of encrypted voice data through file input/output.
- Python-based: Developed in Python, enabling easy integration and customization.

üõ† Intended Users
Ideal for users requiring secure communication channels in various domains, including business, remote work, and confidential discussions.

üì° Use Case Scenarios
Versatile for scenarios like remote meetings, secure business conversations, and any situation where encrypted voice communication is crucial.

üîß Contribution & Collaboration
Contributions from experts in cryptography, audio processing, and software development are welcome to enhance and refine SecureVoiceComms-Pro.

üìñ Documentation
Includes detailed setup and usage instructions, as well as customization guidelines.

Setup and Usage

To use SecureVoiceComms-Pro, follow these steps:
- Environment Setup: Ensure Python and necessary libraries (sounddevice, numpy, cryptography) are installed.
- Recording Audio: Use the microphone for audio input. The system captures and processes this audio.
- Encryption Key: Define a secure encryption key. Replace b'your-encryption-key-32bytes' in the script with a 32-byte key for AES-256 encryption.
- Running the Script: Execute main.py to start the recording, encryption, simulated transmission, decryption, and playback process.
- Output: The decrypted audio is saved as a .wav file, which can be played back to verify the process.

Note
Ensure your encryption key is stored and handled securely. The current implementation is a basic model and should be further adapted for specific operational environments.
