SecureVoiceComms-Pro

Advanced Encrypted Voice Communication System

About SecureVoiceComms-Pro

SecureVoiceComms-Pro is an encrypted voice communication system designed for secure and reliable voice transmissions. Leveraging modern encryption techniques, it provides a robust solution for confidential and clear audio communication.

üåê Features:

- Robust Encryption: Uses standard cryptographic libraries to secure communications.
- Audio Processing: Digital signal processing for audio capture and playback.
- File-based Transmission Simulation: Simulates transmission of encrypted voice data through file input/output.
- Python-based: Developed in Python, enabling easy integration and customization.

üõ† Intended Users
Ideal for users requiring secure communication channels in various domains, including business, remote work, and confidential discussions.

üì° Use Case Scenarios
Versatile for scenarios like remote meetings, secure business conversations, and any situation where encrypted voice communication is crucial.

üîß Contribution & Collaboration
Contributions from experts in cryptography, audio processing, and software development are welcome to enhance and refine SecureVoiceComms-Pro.

Setup and Usage

To use SecureVoiceComms-Pro, follow these steps:
- Environment Setup: Ensure Python and necessary libraries (sounddevice, numpy, cryptography) are installed.
- Recording Audio: Use the microphone for audio input. The system captures and processes this audio.
- Encryption Key: Define a secure encryption key. Replace b'your-encryption-key-32bytes' in the script with a 32-byte key for AES-256 encryption.
- Testing the Code: Execute test.ipynb to start the recording, encryption, simulated transmission, decryption, and playback process.
- Output: The decrypted audio is saved as a .wav file, which can be played back to verify the process.

Note
Ensure your encryption key is stored and handled securely. The current implementation is a basic model and should be further adapted for specific operational environments.




Work In Progress Notes:

Hardware:

    Audio Output (Speaker):
        Connect the speaker pin to a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) on the Raspberry Pi Zero to output decrypted audio signals to the radio.

    Audio Input (Microphone):
        Connect the microphone pin to an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) on the Raspberry Pi Zero to input audio signals from the radio for encryption.

    PTT Control:
        Connect the PTT pin to a GPIO on the Raspberry Pi Zero. You will control this GPIO within your software to simulate pressing the PTT button. When the GPIO is set to low, it should trigger the PTT.

    Ground Connection:
        Ensure there is a common ground connection between the Raspberry Pi Zero and the radio.
        
    Connect the ADC and DAC modules to the Raspberry Pi Zero via the I2C interface.
